# Frequency Counter and Multiple Pointers Practice Problems

NOTE:  See tests for examples of expected results.

__canConstructWord__  
- Accepts two strings: a word and some letters.
- Returns true if the word can be built with the letters that you are given.  
- Otherwise, it returns false.  
- Assume that there are only lowercase letters and no space or special characters in both the word and the letters.  
- Time Complexity: O(m + n) (if m is the length of word and n is the length of letters)


__averagePair__  
- Takes a sorted array of integers and a target average.  
- Returns true if there is a pair of values in the array where the average of the pair equals the target average.  
- There may be more than one pair that matches the average target  
- Time Complexity: O(n)

__twoArrayObject__  
- Accepts two arrays of varying lengths.The first array contains keys and the second one contains values.  
- Returns an object created from the keys and values.  
- If there are not enough values, the rest of keys are assigned a value of null.  
- If there are not enough keys, the rest of the values are ignored.

__sameFrequency__
- Accepts two positive integers.
- Returns true if the two integers contain the same set of digits with the same frequency.
- Returns false otherwise.
- Time Complexity: O(n + m)

__separatePositive__

- Accepts an array of non-zero integers.
- Returns the same array with the positive numbers on the left and negatives on the right, unsorted.
- Time Complexity: O(n)

__is-subsequence__
- Accepts two strings.
- Returns true if the letters in str1 are contained in str2 in the same order as str1.
- Otherwise returns false.
- Time Complexity: O(n + m)

__countPairs__
- Accepts an array of numbers and a target number.
- Returns the number of pairs that add up to the target number and stores the pairs in a variable called sumPairs
- Time Complexity:  
  - First version: O(n)  
  - Second version: O(n*log n)
  
 
__longestFall__
- Accepts an array of integers.
- Returns the length of the longest consecutive run of decreasing integers.

__pivotIndex__
- Accepts an array of integers.
- Returns the pivot index.  This is the index of the number where the some of integers to the left equals the sum of the integers to the right.
- If there is more than one valid pivot index, the smallest index is returned.
-If there is no valid pivot index, -1 is returned.
